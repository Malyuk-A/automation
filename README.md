# Oakestra Automation Helpers

This repo contains automation scripts that help setup and manage Oakestra operations. If you want to push your own automation, please push your updates containing a new folder which contains your code and README.md that explains how to use your scripts.

Please remove any unique identifiers relevant to your setup so that your scripts are usable generally.
